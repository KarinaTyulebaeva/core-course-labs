Dockerfile best practices:

1. Use a minimal base image: Choose a base image that is as small as possible and only includes the necessary dependencies for your application.

2. Keep the image lightweight: Remove unnecessary files and dependencies after installing your application.

3. Use caching wisely: Leverage Docker's caching mechanism by ordering your Dockerfile commands from least to most frequently changed.

4. Use environment variables: Use environment variables to parameterize your Dockerfile and make it more flexible.

5. Use COPY instead of ADD: Use COPY instead of ADD to copy files into your image, as it is more explicit and has fewer side effects.

6. Avoid running as root: Run your application as a non-root user to improve security.

7. Use multi-stage builds: Use multi-stage builds to reduce the size of your final image and improve build time.

8. Define a default command: Define a default command that runs your application when the container starts.

9. Document your Dockerfile: Include comments in your Dockerfile to explain what each command does and why it is necessary.

10. Test your image: Test your Docker image thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected and meets all requirements.
